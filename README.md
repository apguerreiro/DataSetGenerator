DataSetGenerator
===========

Code for generating sets of nondominated points on fronts of different shapes in two and more dimensions.  The generated points have coordinate values in [0,1].

Usage
--------


**Execution**:

    python generateData.py outputFolder dim npoints frontType

where:

- `outputFolder`  : the root folder where the generated points will be saved
- `dim`                : number of dimensions
- `npoints`          : size of the set to be generated
- `frontType`        : name of the front type that determines the shape of the front. It has to be one of the following:  
    - linear
    - convex 
    - concave
    - cliff
    - wave-?

    For the front `wave-?`, the question mark must be replaced by a number greater than 0, which indicates the number of convex regions. For example: wave-1, wave-2, wave-10. 

     
Optionally, arguments `plot` and `plot-save` may be provided as the *fifth* parameter, in which case the set of generated points will be shown in a plot (available for any number of dimensions). If argument `plot-save` is given, the plot will also be saved.
     

**Output**:

Running the code will generate a file that will be saved in `outputFolder/frontType/` where the file name indicates the front type, number of dimensions and the number of points.
                      

Example
-------

    python generateData.py myDataSets 2 100000 linear
    

For this example, the file `linear.2d.100000` will be created under `myDataSets/linear/` and will contain `100000` points with `2` coordinates, over a straigth line between points (0,1) and (1,0).

Optinally, to see the generated points:

    python generateData.py myDataSets 2 100000 linear plot
    
or:

    python generateData.py myDataSets 2 100000 linear plot-save


In which case, the plot will be saved in `myDataSets/figures/linear.2d.100000.png`.
